Spells Are sentences that are spoken in specific languages. Each word in a spell sentence breaks down as one of these
Five things: Noun, Verb, Adjective, Timing, Predicate.

Noun: typically refers to the target. Spells can have one or more of these.
Verb: What the spell will do to the target.
Adjective: How the spell will do the thing.
Predicate: What has to happen for the spell to work. This normally gives the spell a benifit.

Each sentence must be grammatically correct and the user must have enough energy to cast the spell, other wise it will
fizzle.

Example:
Transport me to my Soulhome.

'With the light'

This means that this spell only works in the light. Adding stipulations like this typically makes the spell cheaper.
If this said 'Using the Light', this wouldn't make it cheaper, it would make it more effective.

predicates start with any of these:
With            'With the Shadow'
Using           'Using the Fire'
After           'After the Spell is Spoken'
Until           'Until the Body Moves'
While           'While the Water Flows'

then they are followed by a noun. Some are then followed by a verb if the predicate needs to specify.

These are words that represent things. Choosing the correct word to use is essential for making spells work. The more
general the word is, the more things it will affect and the more the spell will cost. If the spell cost more mana than
what you have, then it will fizzle.

Water - items or blocks that are filled with water. Wet Sponges, water blocks, buckets of water, watter bottles.
